Engine Structure
	Electrical Simulation Archsystem
		Component Generation Subsystem
			Generates components beyond stock, handles user generated components, analyses component statistics for player.
		Circuit Level Behaviour Subsystem
			Handles flow of electricity, interaction between components, etc.
		Component Level Behaviour Subsystem
			Handles component behaviour(I.E special functions like RF, sensors, and oscillators)
		Script Generation Subsystem
			Outputs circuit behaviour as LUA script for efficiency and ease of customization.
			
	Macro Station Simulation Archsystem
		Macro Level Circuit Integration Subsystem
			Handles circuitry interacting with the station and the station with circuitry.(I.E Power, dumb control, etc.)
		Station Networking Subsystem
			Handles connectivity between computers and circuitry.(I.E Data, smart control, etc.)
		*Fluid Flow*
			Proposed system for handling air and other fluid flow through the station. Could come into play during fire, hull breaches, oil spills, etc.
		
	Script Archsystem
		Computer Emulation Subsystem
			Controls the behaviour of emulated computer systems, and their interaction with circuitry and the station. Runs programs on these computers.
		Microcontroller Emulation Subsystem
			Controls the behaviour of microcontrollers and other complex circuitry that has been rendered as a script. Runs programs on these devices.
